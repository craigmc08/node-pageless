# node-pageless
a node.js single-page server

packages all your pages into a single, template-ridden page to make load times *very* fast.

### To-Do
- use http requests to load templates (for faster initial loading time)
- optimize order of http requests based on common link clink order
- make everything not in one file
- make docs
- can probably optimize
